#' @title Calculate Predicted Mean Votes (PMV)
#' @description Function to calculate Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) and .The Function is calculated in accordance to main thermal comfort Standards.
#' @aliases pmv
#' @usage calcPMV(ta, tr, vel, rh, clo=.5, met=1, wme=0, basMet=58.15)
#' @usage PMV(ta, tr, vel, rh, clo=.5, met=1, wme=0, basMet=58.15)
#' @param ta a numeric value presenting air temperature in [degree C]
#' @param tr a numeric value presenting mean radiant temperature in [degree C]
#' @param vel a numeric value presenting air velocity in [m/s]
#' @param rh a numeric value presenting relative humidity [\%]
#' @param clo a numeric value presenting clothing insulation level in [clo]
#' @param met a numeric value presenting metabolic rate in [met]
#' @param wme a numeric value presenting external work in [met]
#' @details The PMV is an index that predicts the mean value of the thermal sensation votes (self-reported perceptions) of a large group of people on a sensation scale expressed from (-3) to (+3) corresponding to the categories cold, cool, slightly cool, neutral, slightly warm, warm and hot. PMV model is limited to air speeds below 0.20 m/s (40 fpm). When air speeds exceed 0.20 m/s (40 fpm), the comfort zone boundaries are adjusted accordingly.
#' @details Note that the adjustments in the value for basMet need to be made with great cautiousness as the PMV calculation is an empirical model and might not be valid for other values of basMet than the one commonly used.
#' @returns PMV - Predicted Mean Vote
#' @examples calcPMV(25,25,0.3,50,0.5,1)
