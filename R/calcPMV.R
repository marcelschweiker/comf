#' @title Predicted Mean Votes (PMV)
#' @description Function to calculate Predicted Mean Vote (PMV).
#' @aliases pmv
#' @usage calcPMV(ta, tr, vel, rh, clo=.5, met=1, wme=0, basMet=58.15)
#' @param ta a numeric value presenting air temperature in [degree C]
#' @param tr a numeric value presenting mean radiant temperature in [degree C]
#' @param vel a numeric value presenting air velocity in [m/s]
#' @param rh a numeric value presenting relative humidity [\%]
#' @param clo a numeric value presenting clothing insulation level in [clo]
#' @param met a numeric value presenting metabolic rate in [met]
#' @param wme a numeric value presenting external work in [met]
#' @param basMet a numeric value presenting basal metabolic rate [w/m2]
#' @details The PMV is an index that predicts the mean value of the thermal sensation of a large group of people on a sensation scale expressed from (-3) to (+3) corresponding to the categories cold, cool, slightly cool, neutral, slightly warm, warm and hot. PMV model is limited to air speeds below 0.20 m/s.
#' @details Note that the adjustments in the value for basMet need to be made with great cautiousness as the PMV calculation is an empirical model and might not be valid for other values of basMet than the one commonly used.
#' @returns PMV - Predicted Mean Vote
#' @examples calcPMV(25, 25, 0.3, 50, 0.5, 1)
#' @author Code implemented in to R by Marcel Schweiker. Further contribution by Sophia Mueller and Shoaib Sarwar.
