\description{
Function to calculate Predicted Percentage of Dissatisfied (PPD).The Function is calculated in accordance to main thermal comfort Standards.
}
\details{
The PPD is an index that establishes a quantitative prediction of the percentage of thermally dissatisfied people determined from PMV. PMV model is limited to air speeds below 0.20 m/s (40 fpm). When air speeds exceed 0.20 m/s (40 fpm), the comfort zone boundaries are adjusted accordingly.

Note that the adjustments in the value for basMet need to be made with great cautiousness as the PMV calculation is an empirical model and might not be valid for other values of basMet than the one commonly used.
