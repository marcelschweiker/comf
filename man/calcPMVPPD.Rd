\description{
Function to calculate Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) and Predicted Percentage of Dissatisfied (PPD).The Function is calculated in accordance to main thermal comfort Standards.
}
\details{
The PMV is an index that predicts the mean value of the thermal sensation votes (self-reported perceptions) of a large group of people on a sensation scale expressed from (-3) to (+3) corresponding to the categories cold, cool, slightly cool, neutral, slightly warm, warm and hot. The PPD is an index that establishes a quantitative prediction of the percentage of thermally dissatisfied people determined from PMV. PMV model is limited to air speeds below 0.20 m/s (40 fpm). When air speeds exceed 0.20 m/s (40 fpm), the comfort zone boundaries are adjusted accordingly.

Note that the adjustments in the value for basMet need to be made with great cautiousness as the PMV calculation is an empirical model and might not be valid for other values of basMet than the one commonly used.
