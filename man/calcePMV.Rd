\title{Calculating Adjusted Predicted Mean Votes}
\usage{
calcePMV(ta, tr, vel, rh, clo = 0.5, met = 1, wme = 0, epCoeff)

ePMV(ta, tr, vel, rh, clo = 0.5, met = 1, wme = 0, epCoeff)

epmv(ta, tr, vel, rh, clo = 0.5, met = 1, wme = 0, epCoeff)
}
\arguments{
\item{ta}{a numeric value presenting air temperature in [degree C]}

\item{tr}{a numeric value presenting mean radiant temperature in [degree C]}

\item{vel}{a numeric value presenting air velocity in [m/s]}

\item{rh}{a numeric value presenting relative humidity [\%]}

\item{clo}{a numeric value presenting clothing insulation level in [clo]}

\item{met}{a numeric value presenting metabolic rate in [met]}

\item{wme}{a numeric value presenting external work in [met]}

\item{epCoeff}{expectancy factor e}
}
\value{
\code{calcePMV} returns the predicted mean vote adjusted through the expectancy factor.
}
\description{
Function to calculate predicted mean votes (pmv) adjusted for cooling effect of elevated air speed, through the expectancy factor by using the function PMVPPD.
}
\details{
\code{epCoeff} can be derived using \code{calcepCoeff}.

\code{calcePMV} requires the actual sensation vote related to the physical data as it is required to alter the metabolic rate.
}
\note{
In case one of \code{epCoeff} is not given, a standard value will be taken from a list (see \code{\link{createCond}} for details.
}
\examples{
## Note. Due to random generated asv values. The values for the coefficients will not be meaningful.
## Create sample data
ta  <- 20:24     # vector with air temperature values
tr  <- ta         # vector with radiant temperature values
vel <- rep(.1,5)  # vector with air velocities
rh  <- rep(50,5)  # vector with relative humidity values
clo <- rep(1.0,5) # vector with clo values
met <- rep(1.1,5) # vector with metabolic rates
asv <- rnorm(5)   # vector with actual sensation votes
lsCond <- as.list(data.frame(ta,tr,vel,rh,clo,met,asv))
## Calculate coefficient epCoeff for data set
epCoeff <- calcepCoeff(lsCond)
## calculate epmv
epmv <- NULL
for (i in 1:length(ta)){
 epmv[i] <- calcePMV(ta[i], tr[i], vel[i], rh[i], clo[i], met[i], epCoeff = epCoeff)$epmv}
epmv
