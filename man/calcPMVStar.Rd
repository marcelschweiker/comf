the Operative Temperature based on the 2-Node-Model}
\usage{
calcPMVStar(ta, tr, vel, rh, clo = 0.5, met = 1, wme = 0, pb = 760, 
ltime = 60, ht = 171, wt = 70, tu = 40, obj = "set", csw = 170, cdil = 120, 
cstr = 0.5)
}
\arguments{

\item{tr}{a numeric value presenting mean radiant temperature in [degree C]}

\item{vel}{a numeric value presenting air velocity in [m/s]}

\item{rh}{a numeric value presenting relative humidity [\%]}

\item{ht}{a numeric value presenting body height in [cm]}

\item{wt}{a numeric value presenting body weight in [kg]}

\item{tu}{a numeric value presenting turbulence intensity in [\%]}

\item{obj}{a character element, either "set" or "pmvadj"}

\item{csw}{a numeric value presenting the driving coefficient for regulatory sweating}

\item{cdil}{a numeric value presenting the driving coefficient for vasodilation}

\item{cstr}{a numeric value presenting the driving coefficient for vasoconstriction}
}
\value{
\code{calcPMVStar} returns the Fanger's PMV except that dry is calculated 
using SET* rather than the operative temperature
}
\description{
\code{calcPMVStar} calculates Fanger's PMV except that dry is calculated 
using SET* rather than the operative temperature based on the 2-Node-Model by 
Gagge et al.
}
\details{
All variables must have the same length 1. For the calculation of several 
values use function \code{calcComfInd}. The value of \code{obj} defines 
whether the function will use the version presented in ASHRAE 55-2013 for 
adjustment of pmv (obj = "pmvadj"), or the original code by Gagge to calculate 
set (obj = "set"). In the version presented in ASHRAE 55-2013, the lines of 
code related to self-generated convection is deleted. Therefore, a difference 
can only be seen at higher values of met.
}
\note{
In case one of the variables is not given, a standard value will be taken 
from a list (see \code{\link{createCond}} for details).

\examples{
## Using several rows of data:
ta <- c(20,22,24)
tr <- ta
vel <- rep(.15,3)
rh <- rep(50,3)

maxLength <- max(sapply(list(ta, tr, vel, rh), length))
pmvstar <- sapply(seq(maxLength), function(x) { calcPMVStar(ta[x], tr[x], vel[x], rh[x]) } ) 
}
